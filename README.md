# Laboration_2_shapes

This is a school assignment where we use inheritance. We have three levels of classes, one base class that two other classes inherits from ( 2D-shape and 3D-shape). Then we have 5 shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle, cuboid and sphere) that in turn inherits from the 2D or 3D class depending on which shape it is. Using vectors we calculated 20 random shapes with their area, volume and/or circumference. There are also a control function that tells the user if the sides of the rectangle and cuboid have equal length (IsCube and IsSquare).
